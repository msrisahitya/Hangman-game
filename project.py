"""This is a program for a chatbot which helps to play HANGMAN.
   1.The bot will start with the greetings at first the bot intoduces itself
     and describes what it will do.
   2.After that bot asks the name of the user and it greets the user and it welcomes user.
   3.The bot first welcomes you by representing a hangman.
   4.In this game the bot picks a random word from the words file which is called as quess word.And then
     bot asks to enter the the random guess letters.If the guess letter matches any letter in the guess word
     the it asks for next one to match.If not the user enters the quess letter which in not in the quess word
     then the hangman starts hanging by adding each part in step by step manner.
   5.If the hangman is fully hanged with all parts then the game is Over.We cannot try any more after that.
   6.Else if Hangman is not completely hanged the we have chances to correctly guess the letters which matches
     the guess word.If we guessed the word correctly then we will win the gam if not
     we lose the game.
